    <div class="article">A wealthy family man took his son on a trip to the country, so he could have his son see how poor country people live. They stayed one day and one night in the home of a very humble farmer. At the end of the trip, and when they were back home, the father asked his son, "What did you think of the trip?" The son replied, "Very nice dad." Then the father asked his son, "Did you notice how poor they were?" The son replied, "Yes." The father continued asking, "What did you learn?" The son responded, "I learned that we have one dog in our house, and they have four. Also, we have a fountain in our garden, but they have a stream that has no end. And we have imported lamps in our garden . . . where they have the stars! And our garden goes to the edge of our property. But they have the entire horizon as their back yard!" At the end of the son's reply the father was speechless. His son then said, "Thank you dad for showing me how poor we really are."
